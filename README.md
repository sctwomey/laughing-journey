# Challenge 20: React Portfolio

## Description
This challenge requires the development and deployment of a developer portfolio website using React and Netlify. When the portfolio is loaded, the user is presented with a page containing a header, a content section, and a footer. The header is viewed, the user will be presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles that correspond to the different sections of the portfolio. When the user views the navigation titles, there will be one for About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact with the title corresponding to the current section being highlighted. When the user clicks the navigation title, the user is presented with the correspoding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

When the user loads the portfolio for the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. When the user is presented with the About Me section, I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about the developer. When the user is presented with the Portfolio section, the user will see titled images of six of the developers applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository. When the user is presented with the Contact section, the user will see a contact form with fields for a name, and email address, and a message. When the user moves the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, the user will recieve a notification that the field in question is required.

When the user enters text into the email address field, the user will receive a notification if the user had entered an invalid email address. When the user is presented with the Resume section, the user will see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies. When the user is presented with the footer, the user will see either text or icon links to the developer's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform.
